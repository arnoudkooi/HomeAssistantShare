    Run a different action for each button on your 8BitDo Micro gamepad.  
    Leave any action blank to skip it.

    The variable `{{ pressed_key }}` will be set to the logical name of the pressed button (e.g., "A", "B", "L2", etc.) for easy mapping to i.e. remote keyboard operations in your automations.
    > **Note:** The ‚≠ê is default to null, I have remapped this to the space bar (key code 57) in the Ultimate Software app on a mobile device.
