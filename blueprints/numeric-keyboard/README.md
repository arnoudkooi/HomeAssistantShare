## Quick Start

**One-Click Import**: Click the button above to automatically import this blueprint into your Home Assistant instance.

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Complete Key Support**: All 17 keys including numbers, operators, and special functions
- ‚úÖ **Individual Actions**: Each key can trigger any Home Assistant action independently
- ‚úÖ **Simple Configuration**: Straightforward setup with no complex sequences
- ‚úÖ **Skip Unused Keys**: Leave any key action blank to ignore it
- ‚úÖ **Single Mode**: Prevents overlapping executions for reliable operation

## Requirements

### Prerequisites
1. **Home Assistant** with blueprint support
2. **Numeric Keypad/Calculator** device properly connected via USB or Bluetooth
3. **keyboard_remote integration** installed and configured

### Bluetooth Keypad Setup (Optional)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Bluetooth pairing can be tedious and may require multiple attempts and system restarts.

If you're using a Bluetooth numeric keypad, you'll need to pair it manually via terminal:

#### Step-by-Step Bluetooth Pairing

1. **Access Home Assistant Terminal**:
   - SSH into your Home Assistant system
   - Or use the Terminal add-on if available

2. **Start Bluetooth Service**:
   ```bash
   bluetoothctl
   ```

3. **Enable Discovery**:
   ```bash
   power on
   agent on
   default-agent
   scan on
   ```

4. **Put Your Keypad in Pairing Mode**:
   - Follow your keypad's manual (usually hold a pairing button)
   - Look for your device in the scan results

5. **Pair the Device**:
   ```bash
   pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
   trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
   connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX
   ```
   Replace `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` with your keypad's MAC address

6. **Exit Bluetooth Control**:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

7. **Restart Home Assistant**:
   - This is often required for the device to be properly recognized
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **System** ‚Üí **Restart**

#### Bluetooth Troubleshooting

- **Device not found**: Ensure keypad is in pairing mode and close to Home Assistant
- **Pairing fails**: Try removing device (`remove XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`) and re-pairing
- **Keys not working**: Restart Home Assistant after successful pairing
- **Connection drops**: Some keypads have power-saving modes that disconnect

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Keys not responding:**
- Verify the device descriptor path is correct
- Check that the keyboard_remote integration is working
- Ensure your keypad is properly connected via USB

**Wrong key codes:**
- Key codes may vary between different keypad models
- Check Home Assistant logs to see actual key codes being sent
- Update the blueprint or automation with correct codes

**Multiple keypads:**
- Each keypad needs its own automation instance
- Use different device descriptor paths for each device

### Finding Your Device Path
1. Connect your keypad
2. Check Home Assistant logs for keyboard_remote events
3. Look for `/dev/input/eventX` in the logs
4. Use this path in your automation configuration

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging for detailed information:

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    homeassistant.components.automation: debug
    custom_components.keyboard_remote: debug
```

## Technical Details

### How It Works
1. **Event Listening**: Each key press generates a `keyboard_remote_command_received` event
2. **Individual Triggers**: Separate trigger for each key with specific key_code
3. **Action Dispatch**: Uses choose/condition logic to execute the right action
4. **Single Mode**: Prevents overlapping executions

### Supported Devices
- USB numeric keypads
- Calculator-style keypads  
- Wireless numeric keypads (if they appear as keyboard devices)
- Any device that sends standard keyboard events

## Customization

### Adding New Keys
If your keypad has additional keys, you can extend the blueprint by:
1. Adding new input definitions
2. Adding corresponding triggers with the correct key_code
3. Adding the action to the choose block

### Key Code Discovery
To find key codes for unlisted keys:
1. Enable debug logging
2. Press the key on your device
3. Check logs for the key_code value
4. Add to your automation configuration
